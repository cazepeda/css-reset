# css-reset
CSS reset styles.

Created a repository for a default css-reset CSS file to use for web development. This is a copy from Andy Bell's newer version of "Modern CSS Reset": https://andy-bell.co.uk/a-more-modern-css-reset/. I couldn't find a new repository of it other than the old version he had originally created. So I created this for myself. MIT license is included.
